To run the code on LAN (Local Area Network):

1. **Backend Server**: running on `http://192.168.1.6:5000`
2. **Frontend Application**: running on `http://192.168.1.6:5173`

**Instructions:**
- Connect your mobile or other devices to the SAME Wi-Fi network as this computer.
- Open the browser on your device and go to: `http://192.168.1.6:5173`
- **NEW**: You no longer need to update `.env` files manually! The system now automatically detects your IP and connects to the backend.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If the frontend doesn't load, ensure your firewall allows Node.js/Vite connections.
- If the backend API calls fail, check that the backend is running and that your phone can ping your PC.
