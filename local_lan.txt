To run the code on LAN (Local Area Network):

1. **Backend Server**: running on `http://192.168.1.6:5000`
2. **Frontend Application**: running on `http://192.168.1.6:5173`

**Instructions:**
- Connect your mobile or other devices to the SAME Wi-Fi network as this computer.
- Open the browser on your device and go to: `http://192.168.1.6:5173`
- **NEW**: The system automatically detects your IP and connects to the backend, but ensures the .env files are correctly set up for your current network.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If the frontend doesn't load, ensure your firewall allows Node.js/Vite connections.
- If the backend API calls fail (e.g. "Login Failed"), check that the VITE_API_URL in frontend/.env matches your IP and port 5000.
- Ensure your phone can ping your PC IP: 192.168.1.6

Current IP Config:
IP: 192.168.1.6
Frontend Port: 5173
Backend Port: 5000
