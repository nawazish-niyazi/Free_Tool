To run the code on LAN (Local Area Network):

1. **Backend Server**: running on `http://192.168.1.31:5000`
2. **Frontend Application**: running on `http://192.168.1.31:5174`

**Instructions:**
- Connect your mobile or other devices to the SAME Wi-Fi network as this computer.
- Open the browser on your device.
- Go to: `http://192.168.1.31:5174`

**Troubleshooting:**
- If the frontend doesn't load, ensure your firewall allows Node.js/Vite connections.
- If the backend API calls fail, check that `http://192.168.1.31:5000` is reachable.
