N.A.I.R Solutions – All-in-One File Converter
=============================================

This document lists all the features of the website, the technologies used for each, a simple explanation of how they work, and the files where the code is written.

1. Convert to PDF
----------------
- Technology: React (Frontend), Node.js, Express, LibreOffice (Backend).
- Explanation: This feature allows you to upload Word documents, Excel sheets, PowerPoint presentations, and common images (JPG, PNG) to convert them into a professional PDF format.
- Code Files:
  - Frontend: /frontend/src/pages/PdfTools.jsx
  - Backend: /backend/src/services/pdfService.js (Conversion logic)
  - Backend: /backend/src/routes/pdfRoutes.js (API route)

2. Convert from PDF
------------------
- Technology: React (Frontend), Node.js, Express, LibreOffice/PDF-Lib (Backend).
- Explanation: This tool takes an existing PDF and converts it back into editable formats like Microsoft Word (.docx) or Excel (.xlsx), or extracts pages as high-quality images.
- Code Files:
  - Frontend: /frontend/src/pages/PdfTools.jsx
  - Backend: /backend/src/services/pdfService.js
  - Backend: /backend/src/routes/pdfRoutes.js

3. Compress PDF
---------------
- Technology: React (Frontend), Node.js, Express, Ghostscript (Backend).
- Explanation: It reduces the file size of your PDF documents (using levels like "Extreme", "Recommended", or "High Quality") so they are easier to share via email.
- Code Files:
  - Frontend: /frontend/src/pages/PdfTools.jsx
  - Backend: /backend/src/services/pdfService.js
  - Backend: /backend/src/routes/pdfRoutes.js

4. Protect & Unlock PDF
-----------------------

- Explanation: "Protect" allows you to set a password on your PDF to keep it secure. "Unlock" lets you remove the password if you know what it is.
- Code Files:
  - Frontend: /frontend/src/pages/PdfTools.jsx
  - Backend: /backend/src/services/pdfService.js
  - Backend: /backend/src/routes/pdfRoutes.js

5. Add Watermark to PDF
-----------------------
- Technology: React (Frontend), Node.js, Express, PDF-Lib (Backend).
- Explanation: Adds custom text or images (like logos) onto every page of a PDF. You can control the opacity, rotation, and size of the watermark.
- Code Files:
  - Frontend: /frontend/src/pages/WatermarkPage.jsx
  - Backend: /backend/src/services/pdfService.js (Watermark logic)

6. Electronic Signatures (eSign)

- Code Files:
  - Frontend: /frontend/src/pages/InvoiceGenerator.jsx
  - Backend: /backend/src/services/invoiceService.js
  - Backend: /backend/src/templates/ (Invoice EJS templates)

8. Image Tools Dashboard (Resize, Compress & Convert)
------------------------------------------------------
- Technology: React, HTML5 Canvas API (Frontend).
- Explanation: A central hub for image manipulation. Users can resize images (change width/height), compress them (reduce KB/MB), and convert between formats like JPG, PNG, and WebP. Processing happens in the browser for privacy and speed.
- Code Files:
  - Frontend: /frontend/src/pages/ImageTools.jsx

9. AI Background Removal (Premium Tool)
--------------------------------------
- Technology: Python, Flask (Backend), Rembg (AI Model), React (Frontend).
- Explanation: Uses artificial intelligence to detect the subject of an image and remove the background automatically. This is a computation-heavy task handled by a dedicated Python service.
- Code Files:
  - Frontend: /frontend/src/pages/BackgroundRemoval.jsx
  - AI Service: /ai-service/app.py
  - Main Backend Proxy: /backend/src/routes/imageRoutes.js

10. Modern Design & User Interface (UI/UX)
-----------------------------------------
- Technology: React, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons), Framer Motion (Animations).
- Explanation: The website uses a modern, responsive design featuring smooth animations, premium typography, and a "clean dashboard" look. Redundant tools are consolidated into their respective hubs (PDF or Image).
- Code Files:
  - Styles: /frontend/src/index.css
  - Main App: /frontend/src/App.jsx
  - Navigation: /frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx

11. Core Infrastructure & Multi-Service setup
---------------------------------------------
- Technology: MERN Stack (Node, Express, React, MongoDB), Python Flask, Docker.
- Explanation: The project runs three distinct services (Node backend on 5000, React frontend on 5173, and Python AI on 5001). They share a central temporary folder for file processing and are orchestrated via a root package.json.
- Code Files:
  - Server Setup: /backend/src/server.js
  - AI Server: /ai-service/app.py
  - Orchestration: /package.json
  - Deployment: /docker-compose.yml

  Deploying on a VPS (like DigitalOcean, Linode, or Hostinger) is the best choice for "N.A.I.R Solutions" because you have full control over the system to install the heavy tools you need (LibreOffice, Ghostscript).

Here is the exact roadmap and the checklist of what you will need to do:

1. The "Must-Have" Checklist for your VPS
Before your code can even start, you must install these on your VPS (assuming Ubuntu):

Node.js & NPM: To run the apps.
PM2: A process manager that keeps your server running 24/7 (even if it crashes or the VPS restarts).
MongoDB: Either install it on the VPS or use MongoDB Atlas (Cloud).
Nginx: To act as a "Reverse Proxy" (this allows users to access your site via nairsolutions.com instead of IP:5000).
The Heavy Lift Tools:
bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libreoffice ghostscript  # CRITICAL for conversions
2. The Step-by-Step Deployment Roadmap
Step A: Preparation (Do this now)
You need to make sure your code doesn't have "localhost" hardcoded everywhere.

Frontend: Create a .env file for the frontend where VITE_API_URL points to your VPS IP or Domain.
Backend: Ensure process.env.MONGODB_URI and process.env.JWT_SECRET are used.
Step B: Transferring Code
The easiest way is to push your code to GitHub and then git clone it onto your VPS.

Step C: Running the Backend
On your VPS, navigate to the backend folder and run:

bash
npm install
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start src/server.js --name nair-backend
Step D: Building the Frontend
Since the frontend is a React (Vite) app, you don't "run" it like the backend. You "build" it into static files:

bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
This will create a dist folder. You will tell Nginx to serve the files inside this dist folder to your visitors.

Step E: Domain & SSL (HTTPS)
Use Certbot (Let's Encrypt) to get a free SSL certificate so your site has the "lock" icon and is secure for user logins.

🚀 Simplified Way: Use Docker
Since you already have docker-compose.yml, you can actually skip manual installation of LibreOffice/Ghostscript on the VPS:

Install Docker and Docker Compose on your VPS.
Upload your project.
Run: docker-compose up -d --build. Docker will automatically set up the OS, the tools, and the code inside a "bubble" so it works perfectly without you touching the VPS system settings.
My Recommendation for Next Steps:
Would you like me to search through your code and find all the places where localhost is used? I can replace them with process.env variables so your code is "deployment-ready" right now.
